üßÆ Project 1: Calculator

Description:
The Calculator project is a basic desktop application built using Java Swing. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for performing fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can interact with the calculator through a graphical number pad and operator buttons. The calculator displays results in real-time and includes functionality to clear the input.

Key Features:
Basic arithmetic operations (+, ‚Äì, √ó, √∑)
GUI interface using Java Swing
Real-time result display
Input validation and error handling
Purpose: This project demonstrates core Java programming concepts such as event handling, GUI design using Swing, conditional logic, and type conversions. It serves as a foundation for learning desktop application development in Java.






‚úÖ Project 2: To-Do List

Description:
The To-Do List is a simple yet effective Java Swing-based desktop application that helps users organize their daily tasks. It allows users to add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks once they are done. The interface is intuitive and visually minimal, using checkboxes (‚òê and ‚úî) to indicate task status.

Key Features:
Add, delete, and mark tasks as done
Graphical task list with visual status indicators
Clean, scrollable interface using JList
Interactive buttons for managing tasks
Purpose: This project showcases the use of data structures (DefaultListModel), event-driven programming, and GUI layouts in Java. It is ideal for beginners to learn how to manage state and user interactions in a Java Swing application.
